        <p>Hi everyone,
            I am so excited to be part of this program learning this course. My dream had been to
            build something that the word is going to recognize not just me but my country by. I am a
            Liberia and I hope to work with everyone in a good atmosphere and build relationships that
            will make the world a better place.
        </p>

        <p>This is my country. It is most often referred to as Sweet Land of Liberity.
            The capital city is Monrovia, a beautiful place with well-layout streets
            and fresh air. I am a big fan of the capital city, Monrovia, but I currently reside
            in Paynesville which is far from the city.
