        <p>Hi everyone,
            I am so excited to be part of this program learning this course. My dream had been to 
            build something that the word is going to recognize not just me but my country by. I am a 
            Liberia and I hope to work with everyone in a good atmosphere and build relationships that 
            will make the world a better place.
